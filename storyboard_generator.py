"""
storyboard_generator.py
Steps 5-6 of the Shorts pipeline: Groq-driven visual storyboard + asset plan.

For each sentence of the script, Groq produces:
  - a plain-English visual description (for the storyboard)
  - a concrete Pexels search term (relatable, non-jargon, searches well)
  - a media_type hint: "video" (default) or "photo" (still with motion fallback)

Generates:
  - storyboard.md          — shot-by-shot visual plan (real per-sentence visuals)
  - captions.srt           — subtitle reference file (timed from real narration
                             when sentence_timings is provided; else estimated)
  - asset_plan.json        — per-sentence [{sentence, search_term, media_type, visual}]
  - timing.json            — per-sentence (start, end) timings used (written so the
                             video assembler reads the SAME timings and stays in sync)
  - thumbnail_notes.txt    — thumbnail design notes

Falls back to keyword-based defaults if Groq is unavailable, so a Groq hiccup
can never hard-fail the pipeline.

VISUAL_PLAN_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You plan the VISUALS for a faceless YouTube Short.
You are given a narration script already split into sentences, plus the title.
For EACH sentence, decide one concrete stock-footage visual that matches what is
actually being said at that moment — so the on-screen clip aligns with the words.

Audience is the GENERAL PUBLIC (non-tech). The clips are free stock from Pexels,
so think in terms of real-world, searchable footage: people, objects, places,
everyday situations. NOT tech jargon, NOT abstract renders.

For each sentence return a JSON object with:
  "sentence":     the sentence text, copied verbatim from the input,
  "visual":       one-line plain-English description of the on-screen visual,
                  tied to THAT sentence's meaning,
  "search_term":  a concrete 2-4 word Pexels search term for that visual
                  (relatable, low-jargon, e.g. "city traffic night",
                  "person phone surprised", "money coins falling",
                  "office desk typing"). Choose terms that actually return good
                  stock footage,
  "media_type":   "video" if a stock video clearly fits, otherwise "photo"
                  (a striking still — a landmark, a face, a specific object).

ALSO produce a SHORT "headline" for the on-screen hook text: a punchy 3-6 word
phrase a non-tech person would click on, tied to the most surprising/relatable
thing in the script. NOT the raw news title. Plain words, no jargon, no emoji.

Return ONLY a JSON object (no fences, no preamble) shaped as:
  {"head": [{"sentence":...,"visual":...,"search_term":...,"media_type":...}, ...],
   "headline": "<the punchy on-screen hook text>"}
The "head" array length MUST equal the number of sentences you received.
